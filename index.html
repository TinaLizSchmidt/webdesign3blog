      <h2>Digital Illustration Design</h2>

      <p>This is an assignment that I actually thought I would hate - designing for a sports team when I don't enjoy sports. During the roughs stage this was not a concept Colin really liked, but since I did like it, I pursued it during the comps stage.</p>
  
      <p> I'm glad I did! In the end I feel really good about my final product (featured above) and I actually enjoyed the assignment. Maybe I'm just great with sports?</p>

    <h2>Web Design Retail Site</h2>

    <p>I love animals and will bring them into any assignment I can! Also, as a small animal owner I know there is a shortage of places that sell appropriate and quality products for the small animal market. I've had hamsters, gerbils, guinea pigs and rabbits (almost all of which were rescues).</p>

    <p> Design-wise I think I usually tend to go vibrant and bold and I'm thinking I'll take a more pastel and gentle approach, but we will see what happens.</p>

    <h2>An adorable and seasonal video</h2>

    <p>Tiny Hamster has an incredible video series on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TinyHamsterOfficial">YouTube </a> that brings me great joy. Above I chose a seaonally appropriate example where tiny hamster has costumed up for Halloween and is trick or treating.</p>

    <p> Hopefully his owner starts shopping at smallmatters.ca </p>
